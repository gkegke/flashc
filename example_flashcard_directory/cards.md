<-- question -->
What is the advantage of friction?


<-- answer -->

Friction allows things to grip to each other. You can pick up a cup due to the
frictional force and an escalator can move its gears due to friction. Nails
and screws stay in walls due to friction. If there was no friction, everything
would just slide off, we wouldn't even be able to walk.

<-- question -->
What are the disadvantages of friction?


<-- answer -->

Frictional force needs to be beat in order for an object to move, wasting more
energy. It also causes wear and tear of parts along with unnecessary heating.


<-- end -->
<-- question -->
What are the methods of reducing friction?


<-- answer -->

Polishing (only to an extent; too much will increase intermolecular
attractions and strengthen friction), lubrication, ball bearings (rolling
friction is less than sliding friction), streamlining and leaving a thin
cushion of air.

  2) Equations related to friction

##--!>

<-- question -->
What is the applied force to an object if the force doesn't make the object
move?


<-- answer -->

F=µₛN => ma=µₛmg => a=µₛg.


<-- end -->
<-- question -->
What is the acceleration of a moving object taking friction into account?


<-- answer -->

a = F-fₖ / m = F-µₖmg / m OR a=(µₛ-µₖ)g.


<-- end -->
<-- question -->
What is the displacement of an object if its given an initial velocity of u
and friction is the only horizontal force acting on it.


<-- answer -->

s=u²/µₖg.
